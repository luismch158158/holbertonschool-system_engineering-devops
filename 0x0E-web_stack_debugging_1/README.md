# 0x0E. Web stack debugging #1
This project is about using your debugging skills, find out what’s keeping your Ubuntu sandbox’s Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many sandboxes as you need to debug the issue. Then, write a Bash script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.
